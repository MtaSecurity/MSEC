First, we have the file zip from admin, then we enter the password to extract this

After extracted, we got 2 files

Open ReadMe.pdf to read the information and get the password to extract file zip

Fortunately, after a quick scan, notice that the insider threat has downloaded chatgpt desktop and simplenote, so that we need to check file .db in 2 files

CHATGPT:

Users/windows/Appdata/Local/OpenAI.../LocalCache/Roaming/IndexedDB/...db

Then we read the file .log and get the details of the conversation between Hacker and ChatGPT

Amazing, we actually get the recovery key to unlock Bitlocker

We are lucky again, this file contain a password, i think that this is the password for secret.zip
